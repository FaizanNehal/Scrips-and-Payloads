# ABOUT

I have created this reporsitory to upload my scripts and payloads that I use for pentesting any websites. All the payloads and scripts that are uploaded here are manually created by me. You will see alot of payloads are similar to the one uploaded before by different Hackers, I agree that most of the payloads are copied from others but here are alos those payloads that I haven't found in any other repository so i decided to create them by myself.

## Types of Payloads

I am uploading the payloads for the following vulnerabilities. I will not upload the payloads for XSS for there are already tons of them all over the github.

* SSRF
* XXE
* Github recon
* GraphQL
* Remote Code Execution
